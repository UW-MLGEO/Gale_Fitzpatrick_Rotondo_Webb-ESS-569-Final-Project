## Research Relevance: Predicting September Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) Changes Using Machine Learning

Our project aims to predict the change in September Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) over the Arctic, based on historical Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and SIC data (or potentially their anomalies). Specifically, we aim to forecast the following September's SIC using training data from 1980 to 2010, with testing on the remaining years. Although this problem could potentially be framed as a classification task (e.g., predicting more or less SIC than the previous year), we opt to treat it as a regression problem. This decision is driven by the general warming of the Arctic and the nonlinear retreat of SIC, which would make a classification model biased towards predicting a decrease in SIC. Moreover, our focus is on the magnitude of the change in SIC, making regression a more suitable approach for our goals.

We justify the use of **supervised learning** for this task, where we will train a model to predict SIC images based on input data from historical SST and SIC images. Supervised learning is ideal as we have labeled data to guide the model's predictions. Given that we only have 30 years of training data, we intend to generate additional data by introducing noise that mimics the climate's internal variability, allowing the model to generalize better.

Our expected outcomes are modest but better than random predictions when using raw SST and SIC data. However, we anticipate improved accuracy when incorporating anomalies, as they indicate deviations in SIC from its long-term mean. It is important to note that our expectations are tempered because SIC levels reached record lows in the years leading up to 2010, which are not represented in our sample. Thus, we hypothesize that a **linear regression** model may be the most reliable solution due to its low variance, which is essential when predicting SIC changes in an environment characterized by nonlinear sea ice retreat.

In summary, we expect machine learning to offer low variance (as in regression) and low bias (as our regression model will naturally exhibit some bias), and we believe that linear regression will provide robust results for this specific regression task. The application of ML to this dataset holds potential for more accurate predictions of SIC changes, which could have significant implications for climate modeling, policy, and decision-making in Arctic regions.
