## Research Relevance: Predicting September Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) Changes Using Machine Learning

Our project aims to predict the change in September Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) over the Arctic, using historical Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and SIC data, or potentially their anomalies. The central objective is to forecast the SIC for the following September based on the patterns observed in previous years. Specifically, we will train the model on data from 1980 to 2010 and test it on the remaining years, from 2010 to 2023. While this problem could be framed as a **classification task** (e.g., predicting whether the SIC will be higher or lower than the previous year), we have opted to treat it as a **regression problem**. This decision arises from the general warming trend in the Arctic and the nonlinear retreat of SIC. A classification model would be inherently biased toward predicting a decrease in SIC, especially in recent years where the Arctic has experienced significant ice loss. For instance, predicting a decrease would likely always be the outcome for the test period, as the ice has been steadily retreating in the last few decades. Moreover, our focus is not just on whether SIC increases or decreases, but on the **magnitude of the change** in SIC across different Arctic regions, which may be affected differently under climate change. This makes regression the more appropriate modeling approach.

We justify using **supervised learning** for this task, as we have labeled data (historical SIC and SST values) that will serve as the ground truth for training the model. Supervised learning is ideal because it allows the model to learn the relationships between the input variables (SST and SIC) and the target output (SIC changes). Given that we only have a relatively small dataset—30 years of training data—we plan to augment the data by artificially introducing noise that simulates the climate's internal variability. This noise will help the model better generalize to unseen data and reduce the risk of overfitting. This approach also allows us to account for uncertainties in climate models, making the predictions more robust.

Initially, we expect the model's performance to be modest, with results better than random predictions when using only raw SST and SIC data. However, we anticipate an improvement in accuracy when incorporating **anomalies** into the model. Anomalies indicate how far the SIC has deviated from its long-term mean, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of ice loss or growth. This is particularly important in a changing climate, where SIC patterns are evolving nonlinearly. By using anomalies, we expect the model to capture the true variability in SIC better than using absolute values alone. However, our expectations are tempered because SIC levels in recent years have reached unprecedented lows, which are not well represented in the historical training data. Thus, while we expect the model to perform reasonably well on the training data, we anticipate challenges in predicting future SIC changes due to the unknowns in the data that fall outside the historical range.

Additionally, because of the nonlinear nature of sea ice retreat, we hypothesize that a **linear regression** model may be the most effective solution for this problem. Linear regression is known for its low variance, which is essential in a climate system where the variability of SIC is highly dependent on complex, nonlinear factors. By using a linear model, we aim to mitigate the risk of overfitting to noise and ensure that the predictions remain robust even in the face of limited data. While a more complex neural network might capture the nonlinearities in the data, it is likely to suffer from high variance due to the relatively small training dataset. Thus, a simpler, more interpretable model like linear regression may offer a more reliable solution for our regression task. That being said, we hope to use deep-learning to rectify this problem and have a chance of a low bias and low variance model, which may be a somewhat lofty goal. Moreover, there is a strong chance that a random forest or other models constructed of many weak models might outperform linear regression or a more complicated deep-learning model. We seek here to find the strongest classic model for our data.

In summary, we expect machine learning to help reduce variance and **low bias**, as regression models inherently exhibit some level of bias. Despite the challenges of predicting sea ice dynamics in a rapidly changing environment, we believe that **linear regression** or potentially **random forest** will provide a stable and robust solution for this task. The successful application of machine learning to this dataset holds significant potential for improving the accuracy of SIC change predictions, which could have wide-reaching implications. These include informing climate modeling, guiding public policy decisions, supporting Arctic ecosystem management, and aiding in the development of strategies to mitigate the impacts of sea ice loss on Indigenous communities and industries that rely on the Arctic’s ice-covered regions. The ability to predict SIC changes with greater accuracy will also contribute to better planning for climate-related risks, such as changes in Arctic shipping routes, resource extraction, and biodiversity conservation.
